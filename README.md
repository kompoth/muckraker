## Contribution
I'm still implementing the basic functionality and want to focus on that for now.
So I'm not going to accept any feature requests or PRs just yet.

In case of any unexpected behaviour please report it by creating an
[issue](https://github.com/kompoth/muckraker/issues). Thanks in advance!
